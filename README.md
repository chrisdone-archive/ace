=====

Attempto Controlled English is a formally defined unambiguous language
which is a subset of the English language.

[Documentation](http://chrisdone.github.io/ace/)

This package provides a tokenizer, parser and printer for that
language. Specifically, it implements the declarative mood and the
interrogative mood. The imperative mood is omitted at this time.

Interpretation rules, conversion to FoL, or any further analysis is
not implemented by this library.

This package is a work in progress. The lexer and parsers are implemented.
